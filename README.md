![APA102](/media/ap102.png "APA102")

This is an LED project using 240 APA102 LEDs. A dedicated 5V DC power supply is used to power an Arduino Uno as well as the LEDs.

Future plans include using a [Sonoff 4ch WiFi Relay](https://www.itead.cc/sonoff-4ch.html) to use as a selector for the FastLED preset to use.
